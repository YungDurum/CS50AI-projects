# CS50AI-projects
The CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course, I deepened my understanding of AI concepts and got experience through projects.

The following concepts where being addressed.

1.  Explored Search Algorithms: I implemented different search algorithms, such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, and A* search, to solve problems and understand how AI finds its way through search algoritms

2.  Knowledge Representation: I learned how to represent knowledge using logic, working with propositional logic and first-order logic to reason about information effectively.

4.  Natural Language Processing: I explored natural language processing (NLP) by developing projects that involved text classification and sentiment analysis. This made me better understand how machines can interpret and analyze human language.

5.  Game Playing: I created intelligent agents capable of playing games like Tic-Tac-Toe, crosswords and Minesweeper, applying strategies and algorithms to enhance their decision-making abilities.

6.   Worked with Convolutional Neural Networks: I learned to build and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). I applied CNNs to projects related to traffic analysis, enhancing my understanding of how AI can interpret visual data.

7.    Explored Recurrent Neural Networks and Language Models: I delved into recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their applications in processing sequential data. I learned how to build and train language models. 
   
For any details about the projects feel free to ask.
