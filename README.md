# CS50AI-projects
The CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course, I deepened my understanding of AI concepts and got me hands on experience through projects.

The following concepts where being addressed, by week.

1.  Explored Search Algorithms: I implemented different search algorithms, such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, and A* search, to solve problems and understand how AI can navigate complex scenarios.

2.  Knowledge Representation: I learned how to represent knowledge using logic, working with propositional logic and first-order logic to reason about information effectively.

3.  Dived into Machine Learning: I gained practical experience with machine learning techniques, including supervised and unsupervised learning. I worked on projects involving decision trees and neural networks, applying these algorithms to real-world datasets.

4.  Natural Language Processing: I explored natural language processing (NLP) by developing projects that involved text classification and sentiment analysis. This made me better understand how machines can interpret and analyze human language.

5.  Game Playing: I created intelligent agents capable of playing games like Tic-Tac-Toe, crosswords and Minesweeper, applying strategies and algorithms to enhance their decision-making abilities.

6. Ethics in AI: I participated in discussions about the ethical implications of AI, examining issues such as bias, privacy, and the societal impact of AI technologies, which helped me develop a critical perspective on the field.

7.  Hands-on Projects: Throughout the course, I completed various hands-on projects that allowed me to apply the concepts I learned in practical ways, reinforcing my understanding and skills in Python programming.

For any details about the projects feel free to ask.
