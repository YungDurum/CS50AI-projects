### Heredity
I built a program to predict the probability of genetic traits being passed down through a family. I used techniques like probability theory, Bayes' theorem, and recursive algorithms to calculate these probabilities based on given family data.

### Pagerank
I implemented an algorithm to rank web pages based on their importance. I used techniques like graph theory, Markov processes, and iterative algorithms to simulate the behavior of web surfers and compute the PageRank of each page.
