*Degrees*
I created a program to find the shortest path between two actors through their movies. I used techniques like data parsing, graph traversal, and implemented the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest connection. The project involved working with a large dataset of actors and movies to build a graph and efficiently search for connections.

*Tic-Tac-Toe*
I built an AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe optimally. I used techniques like game state representation, minimax algorithm, and recursion to create an AI that can never lose. The project involved implementing the logic for the game and ensuring the AI makes the best possible moves.
