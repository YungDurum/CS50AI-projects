### Knights
I created a program to solve logic puzzles involving knights and knaves. I used techniques like propositional logic, knowledge representation, and logical inference to determine the truthfulness of statements made by characters in the puzzles.

### Minesweeper
I built an AI to play Minesweeper. I used techniques like probability, constraint satisfaction, and logical inference to make safe moves and avoid mines. The AI keeps track of known safe and mine locations to make informed decisions.
