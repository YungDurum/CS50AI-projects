### Crossword
I developed an AI to solve crossword puzzles. I used techniques like constraint satisfaction problems (CSP), backtracking, and heuristics to fill in the crossword grid with valid words from a given list.

### Generate
I created a program to generate text based on a given corpus. I used techniques like Markov chains, n-grams, and probabilistic models to produce text that mimics the style and structure of the input corpus.
