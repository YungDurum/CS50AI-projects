# Analysis

## Layer 8, Head 10
Has its attention on the word and what verb is acting on it, so a dicrect object. Has a tendency to give more attention to the determinant of word.

## Layer 8, Head 11

This layer and head focusses on the relationship between prepositions and Noun, and also a little bit with determiners

Example Sentences:
- With Mike I am trying to [MASK] an app in Java.
- I travel to [MASK] from Monday to Thursday

## Layer 4, Head 9 (not sure if this is okay since it is not focussing on a word)

Looks for how strong the relationship is with the questionmark.

- Do you like fish and [MASK]?
- Are you thinking about [MASK]?/Are you thinking about [MASK]./Are you thinking about [MASK]!/ Are you thinking about [MASK]?!
