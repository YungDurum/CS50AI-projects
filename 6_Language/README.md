### Attention
I implemented an AI to perform tasks using attention mechanisms. I used techniques like neural networks, attention layers, and sequence-to-sequence models to focus on relevant parts of the input data.

### Parser
For the CS50 AI Parser project, I built a natural language parser to analyze and understand sentences. I used techniques like context-free grammars, parsing algorithms, and probabilistic models to break down and interpret the structure of sentences.
