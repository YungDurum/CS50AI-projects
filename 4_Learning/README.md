### NIM
In the CS50 AI Nim project, I built an AI to play the game of Nim optimally. I used techniques like game theory, minimax algorithm, and alpha-beta pruning to ensure the AI makes the best possible moves.

### Shopping
I created a program to predict customer purchasing behavior using the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm, focusing on data cleaning, feature extraction, and model tuning.
